# Execute this function as the cueball

# Steps:
#	variables used: stick velocity, stick (long) length, mass, moments of inertia (around hand)
#			ball radius, mass, moments of inertia (around center)
#			strike angle, coefficient of friction (between tip and ball)
#			stkv swPool_V. C_stkl swPool_C. C_stkm swPool_C. C_stkI swPool_C
#			C_r2 swPool_C. C_m swPool_C. C_I swPool_C
#			stka swPool_var00. C_mus swPool_C 
#
#	procedures: 
#			calculate effective coefficient of friction (5.4) mus_eff var00 
#			calculate the value of j (5.5)
#			apply the result to 5.6 and 5.7, get values (magnitudes)
#	    		obtain unit vector form of F, N, vs0 (omega as F x N)
#   			calculate final result in vector form (5.6 and 5.7)
#           or do some easier mess ups
# 
# notice: almost all temp vars use swPool_var00.
