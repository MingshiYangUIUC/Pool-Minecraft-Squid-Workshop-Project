    iii.Add aiming zoom
    iv. prompt players to choose language
    v.  invitation system and spectator system


2.  v.  Invitation system
        Ppl who dont need the messages can get tag swPool_mute in settings.
            Broadcast an invitation with link to join each game, spectate, and begin.
            When one player is summoning the PROMPT, all people without language tag will be asked to select language.
            ppl joined got tag of swPool_waiting; swPool_"gamename", maximum 2.
                Another starting game prompt to the 2 waiting players if two player are waiting for the same game.
            ppl chose spectate got tag of swPool_spec, unlimited.
                Spectator can see messages but has no swPool_poolplay tag. Cannot interact with game formally.
            When choose to begin with 1 player, if there is more player in the server, ask again, if not begin directly.

        Check if player drops after every turn (progression). 
            If multiplayer game is going on and only one player with tag swPool_poolplay, prompt to wait for that player or cancel/start new game.
                Future: HARD: migrate the player profile to another player?
