PS: If not working, check whether the datapack is enabled by:

	/datapack list
Enable it by:

	/datapack enable "datapackname"
  
# Usage
You will be displayed a piece of <<ins>Clickable text</ins>> to open "command window" after (re)loaded the datapack, try clicking on the texts and explore, or wait for the writeup.

Note: problems may occur if this datapack is enabled together with [the original pool datapack](https://github.com/MingshiYangUIUC/Pool-Minecraft-Squid-Workshop-Project).

# How it Works
Conservation of momentum and angular momentum. Neglected deformations, and interactions with edge of pockets. Assumed constant coefficients of friction.

I have not cited any specific references while making it work. Wait for the writeup or try search "not so simple billiards physics" online.

The [rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_snooker) of snooker and [rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackball_(pool)) of 8 ball have been simplified to meet popular common sense.

I suggest you try the [simpler version](https://github.com/MingshiYangUIUC/Pool-Minecraft-Squid-Workshop-Project) if the game is slow!
