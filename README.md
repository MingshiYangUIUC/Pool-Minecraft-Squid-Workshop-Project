# Abstract


# Installation
- Step 1 Download this repository as a zip and unpack.
- Step 2 Go to minecraft saves directory, usually "C:/Users/youUserName/AppData/Roaming/.minecraft/saves".
- Step 3 Choose the world folder in which you want to install the packs.
- Step 4 Go to .../world/datapacks folder.
- Step 5 Move your "Pool-Datapack-Squid-Workshop-1.16.5" folder(not the root folder) into .../world/datapacks folder.
- Step 6 Open Minecraft and open the world.
- Step 7 Type "/reload" command then press enter.
- Step 8 Enjoy

PS: If not working, check whether the datapack is enabled by:

	/datapack list
Enable it by:

	/datapack enable "datapackname"
  
# Usage
You will be displayed a piece of <<ins>Clickable text</ins>> to open "command window" after (re)loaded the datapack, try clicking on the texts and explore, or wait for the writeup.

Note: problems may occur if this datapack is enabled together with [the original pool datapack](https://github.com/MingshiYangUIUC/Pool-Minecraft-Squid-Workshop-Project).

# How it Works
Conservation of momentum and angular momentum, recently added interactions with edge of pockets (friction is neglected there). Neglected deformations.

I have not cited any specific references while making the physics work. Wait for the writeup or try search "not so simple billiards physics" online.

The [rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_snooker) of snooker and [rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackball_(pool)) of 8 ball have been simplified to meet popular common sense. _The rule enforcement of 8 ball is still under development._ The 2005 dimension of pockets on a snooker table is included in the resourcepack as images.

I suggest you try the [simpler version](https://github.com/MingshiYangUIUC/Pool-Minecraft-Squid-Workshop-Project) if the game is slow!

# Notes
1. I am aware of that everything looks amplified, while comparing to reality. This also affects the physics as the radii of balls are one of the most closely related parameters to the physical behaviors. However, the common setting of mouse sensitivity does not provide enough fineness of controlling the cuestick, and it will be much harder to play the game if the balls size are reduced to mimic the real pool experience. Sorry for any "unrealistic concerns" brought to you by my "disloyalty" to the reality.\
However, making the change is not hard, but will make the game run considerably slower. We'll see.
